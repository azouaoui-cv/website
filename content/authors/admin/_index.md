I am a PhD Student enrolled at [Université Grenoble-Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/) and working in the [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en) [Thoth](https://thoth.inrialpes.fr/) team under the supervision of [Julien Mairal](http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/index.html) on Deep Sparse Coding Models for Computer Vision.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Research Engineer for less than a year, already under the supervision of Julien Mairal in the INRIA Thoth team.
I graduated from both [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) and [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home) prior to moving to [Grenoble](https://www.grenoblealpesmetropole.fr/).
